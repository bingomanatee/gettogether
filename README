This is an open source project to schedule events, groups, etc.

It is intended to allow organizers complete control over their groups, events,
calendar, and membership.

THIS I PLEDGE

GetTogether will put ORGANIZZERS and COMMUNITY FIRST

GetTogether will NEVER release a new version on its public server
without COMMUNITY APPROVAL.

You will ALWAYS be able to use the version of GetTogether YOU like,
if GetTogether moves in a direction you don't like.
